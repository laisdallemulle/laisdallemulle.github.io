Technical Specifications - Photovoltaic Project

This photovoltaic project incorporates cutting-edge technology to harness solar energy efficiently. The project comprises the following specifications:

Modules:

- Number of Modules: 896 modules
- Module Power: 550Wp

Inverters:

- Number of Inverters: 4 inverters (75kW) and 3 inverters (60kW)

Total Power:

- Total Photovoltaic Power: 492.8kWp

The project features an extensive array of 896 high-performance modules, each capable of producing 550Wp of power. These modules are designed to optimize energy conversion, resulting in a highly efficient and reliable solar energy system.

To ensure seamless integration and efficient power conversion, the project incorporates a combination of four 75kW inverters and three 60kW inverters. These advanced inverters are responsible for transforming the direct current (DC) power generated by the modules into usable alternating current (AC) power, maximizing energy output and system performance.

With a total photovoltaic power capacity of 492.8kWp, this project demonstrates a substantial capability for generating clean and sustainable energy. The extensive use of modules and the multiple inverters enable the system to efficiently capture and convert solar energy, contributing to a significant reduction in carbon footprint and dependence on traditional energy sources.

These technical specifications form the basis for a highly efficient and reliable photovoltaic system. The project's design ensures optimal power generation and paves the way for long-term energy savings and environmental sustainability.


<h2>About the company</h2>
### Lamar do Brasil Fruticultura

---

Lamar do Brasil is a fruit growing company located in S√£o Joaquim, the apple capital, in Serra Catarinense. The history of Lamar do Brasil began in 1983, through the planting of apples in 6 hectares. In 1994, the orchards reached 18 hectares of plantation. In 2003, the Lamar do Brasil Paking House was inaugurated, with a total area of 26 thousand m¬≤ and a built area of 2500m¬≤ with a storage capacity of 500 tons of apples. In 2015, the Paking House was expanded and so was the storage capacity, increasing to 2,000 tons. This year, it also began storing, classifying and selling fruit from outsourced producers.

Today, Lamar do Brasil has a storage capacity of 5 thousand tons.
