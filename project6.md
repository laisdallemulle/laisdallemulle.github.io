Technical Specifications - Photovoltaic Project

This photovoltaic project is a significant undertaking, designed to harness solar energy on a large scale. The project incorporates the following specifications:

Modules:

- Number of Modules: 2014 modules
- Module Power: 550kWp

Inverters:

- Number of Inverters: 14 inverters (75kW each)

Total Power:

- Total Photovoltaic Power: 1.1MWp

The project boasts an impressive array of 2014 high-performance modules, each with a power capacity of 550kWp. These modules are specifically designed to maximize energy conversion, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency of the solar energy system.

To efficiently manage and convert the power generated by the modules, the project includes a total of 14 inverters, each with a power capacity of 75kW. These state-of-the-art inverters are responsible for converting the direct current (DC) power produced by the modules into usable alternating current (AC) power, ensuring seamless integration with the electrical grid and optimizing energy output.

With a total photovoltaic power capacity of 1.1MWp, this project represents a significant step towards sustainable energy generation. The large number of modules and inverters allows for the efficient capture and conversion of solar energy, resulting in substantial electricity production and a reduced environmental impact.

These technical specifications form the foundation of a robust and highly productive photovoltaic system. The project's scale and capacity make it a noteworthy contributor to the generation of clean, renewable energy, and a testament to the potential of solar power in meeting our energy needs while reducing carbon emissions.
