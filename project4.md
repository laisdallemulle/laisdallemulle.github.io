Technical Specifications - Photovoltaic Project

This photovoltaic project is designed to harness solar energy and includes the following specifications:

Modules:

- Number of Modules: 448 modules
- Module Power: 550Wp

Inverters:

- Number of Inverters: 3 inverters
- Inverter Capacity: 75kW each

Total Power:

- Total Photovoltaic Power: 246.4kWp

These specifications highlight the key components of the system. The project incorporates a total of 448 high-efficiency modules, with each module capable of producing 550Wp of power. This ensures a significant power generation capacity, making the system highly efficient in converting solar energy into usable electricity.

To efficiently convert the DC power generated by the modules into AC power, the project utilizes three inverters, each with a capacity of 75kW. The inverters play a crucial role in transforming and regulating the electricity output, ensuring optimal performance and system reliability.

With a total photovoltaic power of 246.4kWp, this project showcases a substantial capacity for generating clean and sustainable energy. The combination of a large number of modules and multiple high-capacity inverters allows for efficient power conversion and maximum utilization of the available solar resources.

These technical specifications serve as the foundation for a robust and high-performing photovoltaic system, capable of meeting significant energy demands while reducing carbon footprint. The project's design ensures reliable power generation, making it a valuable investment for sustainable energy production.
