Technical Specifications - Photovoltaic Project

This photovoltaic project is designed to harness solar energy and includes the following specifications:

Modules:

- Number of Modules: 167 modules
- Module Power: 410Wp

Inverter:

- Inverter Capacity: 50kW

Total Power:

- Total Photovoltaic Power: 68.47kWp

These specifications outline the key components of the system. The project consists of 167 modules, each with a power output of 410Wp, contributing to the overall power generation capacity. The single 50kW inverter efficiently converts the DC power generated by the modules into usable AC power.

With a total photovoltaic power of 68.47kWp, this project demonstrates a substantial capacity for generating clean and renewable energy. The system has been designed to maximize energy production and optimize performance.

These technical specifications lay the foundation for a high-performance photovoltaic system that can effectively contribute to reducing carbon emissions and providing sustainable energy solutions.
